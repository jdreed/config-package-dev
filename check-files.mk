# Don't include check-files.mk in your rules files directly; instead
# use config-package.mk.

# check-files.mk is used to verify that files on local disk have not
# been modified from the upstream packaged version.  Its only API
# function is adding the following function as a dependency:
#
# $(call debian_check_files,filename)
#
#   Returns the path to a copy of filename that is verified to be
# unmodified from the version shipped by the distribution (by checking
# md5sums).  The function causes the package to fail to build if the
# relevant configuration file has been modified on the build machine.
