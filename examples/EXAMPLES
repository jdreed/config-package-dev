This directory contains example packages using the config-package-dev
system that you can start from in designing your own packages.

debathena-conffile-example-1.0:
    Displaces a configuration file and provides different configuration
debathena-conffile-example-1.1:
    Transforms a configuration file if it exists at build time
debathena-bin-example-1.0:
    Displaces a binary and provides a wrapper script
debathena-bin-example-1.1:
    Upgrades debathena-bin-example-1.0 undoing one of the displacements
debathena-transform-example-1.0:
    Transforms a configuration file
debathena-cron-example-1.0:
    Hides a cron job

Both CDBS and Debhelper 7+ versions are provided, in the cdbs/ and
debhelper/ directories, respectively.


If you are trying to build these packages out of a config-package-dev
source tree (e.g., because you are hacking on config-package-dev), note
that you will need to set a few environment variables to make things
work. For debuild, e.g., try the command

debuild -e PERL5LIB=../../.. -e DH_AUTOSCRIPTDIR=../../.. --prepend-path=../../..

This trick will not work for CDBS, since debian/rules hard-codes an
absolute path to CDBS class and rules files.


For the CDBS examples, note that if you want the control files to be
regenerated from the control.in files, you need to add

DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL=1

to the debian/rules files (or e.g. set it in your environment).

We do not include DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL=1 in these example
rules files because option is banned in official Debian packages (see
the CDBS section of <http://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html>).


config-package-dev supports older versions of debhelper, although
examples are not given.  You can use it in your own packages by adding
dh_configpackage into the list of dh_* commands in debian/rules, before
dh_link.
