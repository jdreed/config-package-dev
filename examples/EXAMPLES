This directory contains example packages using the config-package-dev
system that you can start from in designing your own packages.

debathena-conffile-example-1.0: Example package using DEB_DIVERT_FILES to divert configuration files
debathena-bin-example-1.0: Example package diverting binaries using DEB_DIVERT_FILES
debathena-bin-example-1.1: Upgrade of debathena-bin-example-1.0 removing one of the diversions using DEB_UNDIVERT_FILES.
debathena-transform-example-1.0: Example package using DEB_TRANSFORM_FILES
debathena-cron-example-1.0: Example package using DEB_REMOVE_FILES to disable a cron job

Note that if you want the control files to be regenerated from the
control.in files, you need to add

DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL=1

to the debian/rules files (or e.g. set it in your environment).

We do not include DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL=1 in these example
rules files because option is banned in official Debian packages (see
the CDBS section of <http://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html>).
