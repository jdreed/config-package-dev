Description: CDBS modules for building configuration packages
 This package contains a system of CDBS modules for creating Debian
 configuration packages: packages that configure an existing Debian
 system by using dpkg-divert on configuration files.  These modules
 attempt to make the process of creating configuration packages
 efficient by checking the md5sums of upstream configuration files
 that are to be modified and automatically generating the relevant
 postinst code to perform the diversions using the standard debhelper
 mechanism.
 .
 The config-package-dev modules are optimized for site defaults (i.e.
 configuration for a university or a company), though they are useful
 for other applications as well.
